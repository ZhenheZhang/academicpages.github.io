# About me
I received my Bachelor’s degree in EECE at Huazhong University Of Science and Technology (HuST) in 2011.
I obtained my Ph.D. degree in EESE at University Of Birmingham (UoB) in 2017, supervised by Prof. Clive Roberts and Dr. Edward Stewart.
During PhD study, I was also a research assistant at Birmingham Centre for Railway Research and Education (BCRRE) from 2015 to 2017.
After graduation, I joined Huawei P&S Business Group in 2018 as a Senior Engineer. Then joined Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab in 2019.
<br><br>
Currently, I am a **Principal Researcher** at Speech and Semantic Lab in **Huawei Noah’s Ark Lab**.
I am leading a research team in Shenzhen. We are focusing on industrial research in deep learning and high-level recognition machine learning technics in Speech and NLP in Huawei.

# Research Interest
Recently, my research interest includes:
<br>
1. Large-scale Pre-training language model, long contextual pre-training, summarization/auto-generation in LLM data engineering.
2. Multi-modality Learning, such as speech-text joint pretrained models, large-scale pretrained models.
3. Speech Tokenization: Vector Quantization (VQ) technics in self-supervised learning.
